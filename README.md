# AI-Based-ChatBot
This repository contains a chatbot that enables users to upload files as input, which then uses them to train itself. The chatbot parses the data from the file and generates its responses on the content (information) within the file, providing customized answers tailored to the information it has been trained on.

### Key Features:

**File Upload Training:** The chatbot accepts various file formats (e.g., text, CSV, PDF) and extracts relevant data to learn from.

**Dynamic Responses:** After processing the file, the chatbot generates responses specific to the uploaded data, offering accurate and contextual answers.

**Easy Integration:** Designed to be integrated with web applications, this chatbot can be easily added to existing platforms like WordPress or standalone PHP-based sites.

 **Customizable & Extensible:** The chatbotâ€™s architecture allows for easy modifications, enabling it to handle specific domains of knowledge depending on the input file.
